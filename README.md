## 💼 Professional Experience

### **AI Developer Intern — Semper8 International (Toronto, ON)**  
**Sept 2023 – Dec 2023**

Contributed to the design and prototyping of an AI-driven candidate assessment system integrating speech emotion recognition and NLP-based contextual analysis.

- Developed CNN-based speech emotion recognition model using RAVDESS, TESS, CREMA-D, and SAVEE datasets (~62% baseline accuracy)
- Extracted MFCC and spectrogram features for supervised classification
- Explored CNN-LSTM multimodal architecture combining audio signals with ASR-transcribed text
- Designed workflow integrating Speech-to-Text (ASR) with transformer-based NLP analysis
- Built dynamic GUI prototype for dataset upload, retraining, and model versioning
- Implemented retraining pipeline including preprocessing, stratified splits, feature extraction, and evaluation
